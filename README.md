**Indian Stock Market Analysis with MySQL**


This exploration applies advanced SQL techniques and robust database design to perform a detailed data-driven analysis of the Indian stock market.

**Overview**

This repository serves as an introduction to my project focused on analyzing the Indian stock market. This repository displays my competencies in creating database structures alongside advanced SQL analysis skills and making decisions based on data insights. This project was developed to exhibit how I handle actual data problems through accurate and creative solutions.

**Project Goals**

 - Develop a solid relational database design to handle Indian stock market information including company data alongside market indices and portfolio management details.

 - Develop advanced SQL queries to perform technical analysis while evaluating portfolio performance and conducting data validation.

 - Through this project I demonstrate my mastery in automation techniques along with data quality assurance and performance optimization practices.

 - Develop a simple-to-install project with comprehensive documentation and attractive visual design for portfolio visitors.

**Key Features**

 - **Schema Design**: The database schema includes separate tables for storing companies, indices, stock data and index constituents as well as portfolio holdings. Data integrity is maintained through foreign key relationships and unique constraints.

 - **Data Ingestion**: Stored procedures to load and update stock data while implementing error handling mechanisms.

 - **Advanced Analysis**: Technical indicators (RSI, moving averages, Bollinger Bands). Sector performance analysis. Portfolio performance tracking (unrealized P&L, percent return).

 - **Data Validation**: Data validation queries identify duplicate records and missing values while checking for data integrity problems.

 - **Performance Optimization**: Indexing and partitioning for large datasets.

 - **Sample Data**: This database includes prepared sample data that enables testers to conduct demonstrations and tests quickly.

**Why I Built This**

The crossroads of data analysis and financial systems has consistently intrigued me. Through this project I integrated my enthusiasm for SQL, data analysis work, and Indian stock market analysis into one unified portfolio segment. The project demonstrates my dedication to providing clear documentation alongside strong design principles and real-world application of sophisticated SQL techniques.

**Example Analyses**

 - **Technical Indicators**:

    - **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Identify overbought/oversold stocks.

    - **Moving Averages & Bollinger Bands**: Identify market trends and measure market volatility.

**Sector Performance**:

Identify the sectors that deliver the best performance throughout specific periods like election quarters.

**Portfolio Tracking**:

Monitor your investments by calculating unrealized P&L and keeping track of your returns.

**My Process**

 - **Schema Design**: I began by creating the database schema on paper while paying close attention to normalization and relationships.

 - **Data Ingestion**: My stored procedure manages loading and updating data while maintaining high data quality standards.

 - **Advanced Queries**: My work involved creating complex SQL queries that utilized window functions together with Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and subqueries.

 - **Validation & Optimization**: I wrote queries for data validation and improved performance through index optimization and partitioning.

 - **Documentation**: The documentation of my project workflow and solutions aims to provide accessibility for other users.

**Challenges & Solutions**

 - **Challenge**: Ensuring data integrity across multiple tables. **Solution**: Used foreign keys and unique constraints.

 - **Challenge**: Handling large datasets efficiently. Solution: Implemented indexing and partitioning.

**Documentation**

 - **Project Design**: Refer to project_design.md to find detailed schema design and query logic notes.
